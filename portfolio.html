        <p> My data science learning has been a <span class = "emphasized"> combination of liberal arts curriculum and self-guided learning. </span>
            While my liberal arts institution <i> <strong>  doesn't have a data science major (even a Statistics/applied math one, for 
                that matter!) </strong> </i> I took care to build strong foundations in all the relevant languages, processes, and background
                knowledge needed to succeed in growing in this data science industry. </p>

    </div>
    <p> A common challenge data scientists face is the "black box" mentality. You can learn how to execute k-means neighbors or 
        a simple linear regression but really knowing <i> what a model does </i> and <i> when it is the <strong> best model </strong></i>
        requires critical thinking and robustness checks. My learning path balances passive learning with application. A liberal arts 
        education trains you to write effectively, taking the leading role with clubs/organizations, and apply multiple different 
        frameworks of understanding to solve cross-disciplinary problems. </p>
