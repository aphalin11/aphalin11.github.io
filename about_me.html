            <h2> My Goals </h2>
            <p> My goals are to work in a cozy place filled with nerds. I want to drink coffee on the regular and 
                write nice code, and collaborate in team settings. I want the opportunity to explore the world of information
                and learn something new every day, whether it be a skill or a insight about some field in finance, 
                technology, physics, or biology. 
                Back at home, outside of my career I  want to own a yard in which I can routinely manage and grow my own 
                prairie, and to have some money to spare to take camping vacations and attend concerts and try lots of different 
                craft beers. 
            </p>
            <h2> My Interests </h2>
            <p> Outside of school and building my career, I am interested a lot of things. I spent lots of time outside, gardening and  
                doing weekly restoration work as a volunteer with my past internship bosses. I take inspiration from a wide variety of 
                cooking shows and my own cooking in my on-campus Co-Op living situation to learn new dishes and bake new desserts at least 
                once a week. My favorite dish I've ever made was grapeleaf-lavender appetizer with egg-plant parmasean and garlic bread. 
                If I'm lazy, my downtown will consists of watching and re-watching seasons of Survivor (I am a huge fan!) and 
                playing Overwatch. 
            </p>
            <h2> My Role Models </h2>
            <p> My role models in life are Winnie the Pooh, for his calmness and easygoingness given whatever circumstance he encounters. 
                But also Professor Adam Loy, who taught my early Statistics courses and modeled to me a level headed thinker, 
                who keeps things simple and loves to explain with nerdy anecdotes. Lastly, my mother for her boundless 
                steadfastness to achieve goals in life. 
            </p>
            <h2> Favorite Movies and Favorite Directors </h2>
            <p> My favorite movies can be divided into different categories: I love the heartfelt and realistically-depicted relationship 
                movies like "Little Miss Sunshine" and "The Darjeeling Limited". I also love cerebral science fiction that makes you feel like there's a rock 
                in your gut at the end. 
                My favorite directors are David Fincher, Wes Anderson, 
            </p>
