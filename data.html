                <p class = "stat_sum"> Statistics, to me, is the opportunity to learn <i> <strong> how to learn </strong></i>. 
                    Through statistical thinking and research, I've developed tools for data visualization, model-fitting accurate regressions, 
                    and telling a useful story that uncover the latent information within datasets. This skill, to me, is valuable and exciting - 
                    everyday I get to learn more about a new form of regression, a new idea in machine learning, or in application I learn 
                    some new fact within whatever field I'm researching. The boundlessness of learning is what excites me about Statistics. </p>

                        In the beginning of Econometrics we were told to do a simple, guided regression assignment using a specified variable 
                        and model. I decided on my free time to explore a food insecurity index variable as a independent variable, and 
                        run a simple OLS regression on a number of predictor variables - race, population, drought risk, etc.

                    the current literature focused on the cropland and natural areas of the Midwest and begin developing a framework for
