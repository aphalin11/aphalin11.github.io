            <h3 class = "red_center"> Liberal Arts: A Self-Made Path </h3>
            <p> Liberal Arts students leave school with a number of important skills. 
                However, unlike more specialized degree-seekers, students from 
                colleges like Lawrence need to make out their story. This is because a 
                work history like my own doesn't always show a clearly marked path. 
                It needs sign-posting just like my Greek and Roman epics paper did. 
                It needs interpretation and a mission statement. 
            </p>
            <p> My experience at Lawrence taught me how to think critically, 
                make important connections across disciplines, and apply 
                diligence to the high-standards classwork I was submitting on
                a daily basis. All of this "liberal arts" learning did not come 
                at the expense of technical skills. I was able to learn tangible 
                processes, mathematics, and computer science either on the side 
                or through specific class choices. And I applied this learning in a 
                number ways, that can be seen through <a href = "./portfolio.html"> my portfolio. </a>

                and outside of undergrad to build up skills in the three broad areas of

                <p> With this internship, I was the sole field restorationist for the last
                    few months of the summer. Five different sites, varying in their
                    ecosystem type (river-bank, prairie, woodlands) were places of
                    potential but not current biodiversity. It was mainly a
                    collection of disturbed soils choked out by aggressive,
                    invasive plant species, and suffering from a litany of
                    environmental challenges such as erosion.
                    <br>
                    This internship was a fantastic opportunity for me to grow as
                    an environmentalist and as an independent, hands-on problem solver.
                    I was able to take my experiences the previous summer and my
                    own ecological studies (I have learned every common species known to the
                    midwest plant ecosystem by botanical name!) to design my
                    <strong> own  management strategy</strong>. This involved:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Independently arriving to the location with the commission's own

                            present as well as current ecological challenges.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong> Recognizing problems and deciding on a course of action</strong>:
                            either mechanical methods (erosion mats, mowing) or
                            chemical (herbicide application).

                <p> This job was a collaborative and early
                    introduction to ecological stewardship. Here, I learned
                    from a number of leading prairie management experts
                    on a variety of management methods and gained skills

                <p> Policy Debate is an intellectually challenging and enriching 
                    activity. To succeed in competitions requires pre-emptive planning, 
                    intensive and purposeful research, and teamwork collaboration. As I 
                    matured as a debater I learned how to synthesize arguments, draw 
                    from important points, and communicate with confidence and persuasion. 
                    My ambition and devotion to debate allowed me into a leadership position 
                    with the team. I began working with my team to resolve two prominent 
                    group challenges my team was facing: first was that files were unsorted 
                    and difficult to reach. The second was that we lacked research for key 
                    important arguments. I took initiative: </p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                        <li> I spearheaded major team collective research efforts, 
                            designating duties among team members. 
                        </li> 
                        <li> Took on several team lectures to train debaters in a certain 
                            argument fields: philosophy, policy, etc. 
                        </li>
                        <li> I assisted fellow debaters with research finding and reporting. </li>
                        <li> Inspected research and case arguments for quality and coherency. </li> 
                        <li> Organized files into a dropbox depository and microsoft

                    <p> This skills only continued when I joined <i> Model UN </i> during my undergrad.
                    Here, I took on the role of researcher coordinator and portfolio manager. 
                    I learned how to build country-specific case studies and effectively 
                    coordinate with other delegates to build coherent policy structures during

                <h3> <strong> Busser</strong>, Smith and Wollensky </h3>
                <p> Having worked in the fast paced service industry at a 
                    intersection of fine dining, steakhouse ettiqutte, and 
                    inner city foot traffic, I don't want to omit this experience 
                    from my resume. The service industry requires you to think 
                    fast, think ahead, and communicate well. The high stakes of 
                    miscommunication at a job like this speaks volumnes for the type of
                    responsibility I've learned as a Busser.
